        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a></h3>

            <p>Apple’s homepage features large product images, short headlines, and plenty of whitespace. The layout is simple and minimal, making it easy to scan and understand the primary content.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> High contrast between text and background with bold typography for clarity and emphasis.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent use of fonts, colors, and button styles throughout the site for a unified brand experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Clean grid alignment keeps images, text, and buttons neatly organized.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related content is grouped together with large spacing between separate product sections.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngren</a></h3>

            <p>Arngren is a highly cluttered classified and gadget site filled with tiny images, dense text, and scattered elements. There is no clear layout or structure, making navigation difficult.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Many colors are used with no hierarchy, and text often overlaps busy backgrounds, reducing readability.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is no consistent styling of fonts, colors, or elements, resulting in visual chaos.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements appear randomly placed with no recognizable grid or alignment structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Unrelated items are crammed together with little spacing, making it unclear what belongs together.</li>
            </ul>
